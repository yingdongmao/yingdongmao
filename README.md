## 🔬 Research Projects  
- 📄 [**Ex-Ante Risk Premia on Earnings Announcements: Evidence from the Options Market**](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4342267) with [Hong Liu](https://apps.olin.wustl.edu/faculty/liuh/), [Xiaoxiao Tang](https://sites.google.com/view/xiaoxiaotang-homepage), and [Guofu Zhou](https://apps.olin.wustl.edu/faculty/zhou/)

  + 🔍 Key Contribution: The first paper to provide estimates of the ex-ante risk premium on earnings announcements.
  + 📊 Findings: Earnings announcements risk premia predict underlying stock returns and straddles around earnings dates.
  + 📈 Innovation: Developed an "EA-managed S&P 500 portfolio" that enhances the Sharpe ratio of the unmanaged version by 51%.

- 📈 [**The Information Content in the Implied Volatility Surface Around Earnings Announcements**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CFTNOC7vzK7B1x5FCDE3rwUl3aoq81We/view)
  + 🔧 Methodology: Constructs a measure quantifying implied hedging demand (denoted as $RRP^v$) for holding an individual stock before corporate events.
  + 📖 Framework: Borrows methodology from [Carr and Wu 2020](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jofi.12894) to decompose the implied volatility surface of equity options.
  + 💡 Insight: $RRP^v = \text{volatility risk premium} \times \text{hedge ratio}$. This measure predicts realized returns before earnings announcements.
    
- 📉 [**Improving the Performance of Volatility-Managed Portfolios**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jup9STywj8tdWz_Q2ovsbeG96WlEo2wk/view)

  + 🛠️ Innovation: Developed a "Downside Managed Portfolio" that adjusts portfolio weight based on predictions of market downturns.
  + ⚙️ Practicality: "Downside Managed Portfolio" incorporates real-time predictability and survives transaction costs, addressing two major issues in [Volatility-Managed Portfolios](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jofi.12513) by Moreira and Muir (2017).
  + 🧪 Research Insight: Explores the long-standing "p-hacking" issue by revealing the trade-off between type 1 and type 2 errors. Proposes a solution to balance these errors in discovering profitable trading strategies.
